# LearnCodeUtrecht

## Background

Learn Code Utrecht (LCU) is a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-to-code-together/)
that is organized by [RikSchoonbeek](https://github.com/RikSchoonbeek).

Initially, novices programmers joined, but nowadays there is a mix of junior, medior,
senior and even architects that work together on various projects written in various
languages like Java, Python and JavaScript.

LCU could be compared with a training ground. If for example the best footballers of the
world do not train on a daily basis then their performance will drop. Even the most
experienced developers should train and learn on a daily basis.

## Aim

The aim of LCU is to learn, maintain and improve programming skills of new and experienced
developers.

## Methods
